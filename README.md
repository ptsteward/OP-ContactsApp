# OP-ContactsApp
Sample Contacts App for OfferPad.

# Description
This is a simple demo app that pulls in contacts data and lets the user view detailed contact info. The user can also select a favorite contact that will be displayed at the top of the contact list. The contacts list is also searchable.

# Design
The app is built using MVVM and dependency injection. Additionally an EventToCommandBehavior and TextChangedBehavior have been added to extend the functionality of ListView and SearchBar respectively.
